# ComicBookViewer
This is a comic book viewer made by me, as my first python project for university.

It is all in french, but if you ask for it, I will make an english-translated version.

It only supports .cbz files because my mac decided it wouldn't work with .cbr files.

To use the program, you must download the rarfile module by writing pip install rarfile into your console.
