# ComicBookViewer
This is a comic book viewer made by me, as my first python project for university.

The .zip file contains the .py program and a folder with all the icons used in the program.

I have put a comic book file here (Spider-Man Team-Up 02 - silver surfer.cbz), but you can download more here if you want : http://digitalcomicmuseum.com. You will have to create an account in order to download a book.

It only supports .cbz files because my mac decided it wouldn't work with .cbr files.

It is all in french, but if you ask for it, I will make an english-translated version.

To use the program, you must download the rarfile module by writing pip install rarfile into your console.
